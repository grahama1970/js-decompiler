# Test Ollama Analysis

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user provided three JavaScript functions and wants a brief analysis. First, I need to figure out each function's purpose. 

Example1 just returns "Hello World", so it's a simple greeting. Example2 takes two arguments and adds them, so that's a basic arithmetic function. Example3 checks if a number is greater than 10 and returns a string based on that. 

Overall, these functions seem to be examples of different types: a constant return, a mathematical operation, and a conditional check. The patterns here are straightforward, each doing one specific task. They don't have any complex structures or dependencies. 

For the module name, since they're all simple utility functions, maybe something like "UtilityFunctions" or "BasicExamples". But the user wants it concise. Maybe "BasicUtilities" or "SimpleFunctions". Let me check the instructions again. The analysis needs to be 2-3 sentences. So the purpose is to demonstrate basic functions, the pattern is simple, single-responsibility functions, and the module name could be "BasicUtilities".
</think>

1. The functions demonstrate basic operations: returning static values, performing arithmetic, and conditional checks.  
2. They follow a simple, single-responsibility pattern with clear input-output logic.  
3. Module name: "BasicUtilities" or "SimpleFunctions".
